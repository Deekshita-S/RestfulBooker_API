# RestfulBooker_API

**API testing using Postman tool**

The Resful Booker API is a collection of all the test cases I created using POSTMAN tool to test Restful-booker API. Each request type is tested individually and tested end-to-end, with positive and negative test cases.

Find the link to Postman collection documentation here -[My postman collection documentation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/26931241/2s93eX1DEH). Here you will find all the requests, responses, test scripts etc to validate the response that I created to test the API.
